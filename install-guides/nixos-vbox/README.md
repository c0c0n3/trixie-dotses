NixOS VirtualBox VM
===================
> How to build a simple NixOS VM with VirtualBox.

Here's how you build my `madematix` VM:

* [Creating the Virtual Machine][create-vm].
* [NixOS Guest Installation][guest-install].

I've used these instructions to build the core system of other dev VM's.
Bear in mind these instructions are for VirtualBox running on a MacBook
Pro Retina 15 so there may be things you should tweak if you run on a
different host system: number of cores, RAM, screen resolution (HiDPI)
and shared folders spring to mind...




[create-vm]: create-vm.md
    "Creating the Virtual Machine"
[guest-install]: guest-install.md
    "NixOS Guest Installation"
