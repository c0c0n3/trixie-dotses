And All the Rest
================

The NixOS wiki has some pages about [hardware configuration][nixos-wiki-hw]
(printers, bluetooth, etc.) not covered in the manual. Other than that,
you can read articles on the Arch wiki (like those collected in the [General
Recommendations][arch-recommends]) and try to Nixify Arch configuration.
Also, like I said, [learning from other peeps configs][nixos-wiki-dotfiles]
is a good idea. For everything else, well, you know, Google is your friend!
